# Foxglove Integration — Architecture & Message Spec

## Scope

How Foxglove fits around the existing ESP ↔ Jetson bridge: every topic,
parameter, and service; who talks to whom; and how multiple simultaneous
operators/observers see the same live system.

This spec assumes the decision already made: **the ESP is not changing.**
No micro-ROS, no firmware changes, no protocol changes. Foxglove becomes the
full operator interface — observability, tuning, **and control**
(arm/disarm/motor test) — by extending the existing Jetson bridge node.

**Safety model:** the sub has a **physical kill switch**, and that is the
safety backstop for live testing — not a software presence mechanism. Earlier
drafts of this spec kept command authority tied to the webapp's browser-tab
heartbeat specifically to guard against an operator disappearing unnoticed.
With a physical cutoff someone can reach at all times during a live test,
that software guard is a convenience, not the thing keeping people safe, so
control is free to move into ROS/Foxglove. See §"Safety model" below for the
full reasoning and the one procedural rule this still implies.

The webapp ([ground_station.md](ground_station.md)) is retained during the
transition — it's built and works today — and retired once the Foxglove
control path (this spec) is built and proven. See
[ros_link.md](ros_link.md) for why the ESP↔Jetson link is a custom serial
protocol rather than ROS, and [pid_tuning.md](pid_tuning.md) for the tuning
workflow this extends.

The ESP side of the bridge is exactly what's already built. Everything new
in this document lives in the Jetson bridge node and above it.

## What doesn't change

- Firmware, `Protocol.h`, every message type, `Safety`, the hardware
  watchdog, the sensor-timeout failsafe — untouched.
- The ESP never speaks ROS.
- `gcs_server.py`'s `SerialHub` (owns the one serial port, fans out to
  WebSocket clients) — unchanged, only extended.

## The Jetson bridge node — responsibilities

| Responsibility | Status |
|---|---|
| Own the serial port | existing (`SerialHub`) |
| Subscribe to EKF odometry, forward as `Pose` frames to the ESP | existing (`--ros`) |
| Relay WebSocket bytes ⇄ serial for the webapp (bench fallback) | existing |
| Decode ESP `State` frames and publish as a ROS topic | **new** |
| Expose PID gains/authority/setpoints as ROS 2 parameters; push edits to the ESP | **new** |
| Expose Save/Reset as ROS services | **new** |
| Expose Arm/Disarm as a ROS service | **new** |
| Send continuous Heartbeat to the ESP while it reports armed | **new** — see §"Safety model" |
| Expose motor test as a ROS topic | **new** |
| Publish link health as diagnostics | **new** |

## ROS interface catalog

### Topics published (Jetson → ROS graph → Foxglove)

| Topic | Type | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/tardigrade/esp/state` | `tardigrade_interfaces/EspState` (new, below) | ~20 Hz | decoded `State` frames |
| `/tardigrade/esp/diagnostics` | `diagnostic_msgs/DiagnosticArray` | on change / few Hz | CRC errors, pose drops, disarm reason |

### Topics subscribed (ROS graph → Jetson → ESP)

| Topic | Type | Rate | Sink |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/tardigrade/state/odometry/filtered` | `nav_msgs/Odometry` | 30 Hz | repacked into `Pose` frames — unchanged, see [ros_link.md](ros_link.md) |
| `/tardigrade/thrusters/test_cmd` | `std_msgs/Float32MultiArray` | on change | 8 elements, index = thruster, value -1..+1 → individual `SetMotor` frames |

### ROS 2 parameters (declared by the bridge, editable via Foxglove's Parameters panel)

Mirrors [`control/Parameters.h`](../firmware/include/control/Parameters.h)
directly, one parameter per gain:

```
depth.kp   depth.ki   depth.kd
yaw.kp     yaw.ki     yaw.kd
roll.kp    roll.ki    roll.kd
pitch.kp   pitch.ki   pitch.kd
authority
depth_setpoint
heading_setpoint
```

A parameter-change callback on the bridge builds a `SetParameter` frame and
writes it to the ESP — the same translation pattern already proven for pose,
run in the opposite direction.

### Services

| Service | Type | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `/tardigrade/save_parameters` | `std_srvs/Trigger` | sends `SaveParameters` (`0x09`) |
| `/tardigrade/reset_parameters` | `std_srvs/Trigger` | sends `ResetParameters` (`0x0A`), then re-syncs the ROS parameter values to the restored defaults |
| `/tardigrade/set_armed` | `tardigrade_interfaces/SetArmed` | sends `Arm` (`0x02`) or `Disarm` (`0x03`) depending on the request's `armed` field |

`SetArmed.srv` already exists in `tardigrade_interfaces` (from the earlier
PX4 architecture) — `bool armed → bool success, string message`. Reusing it
rather than inventing a new type.

## Message draft

```
# tardigrade_interfaces/msg/EspState.msg
# Mirrors the State (0x80) telemetry frame in Protocol.h.
builtin_interfaces/Time stamp
float32 roll               # rad
float32 pitch              # rad
float32 yaw                # rad
float32 depth               # m, ENU z (VehicleState.altitude_m)
float32 vertical_velocity   # m/s
bool armed
bool state_valid
bool altitude_valid
bool link_ok
bool pose_ok
```

Lives in the existing `tardigrade_interfaces` package alongside
`RobotStatus.msg` — no new package needed. `DiagnosticArray` is a standard
message type; no custom definition required for link health (keys like
`crc_errors`, `pose_drops`, `last_disarm_reason`).

## Data flow walkthroughs

**Telemetry out:**
```
ESP → State frame (serial) → bridge decodes (tp.decode_state, already built)
    → publish EspState on /tardigrade/esp/state
    → every connected Foxglove client sees it live
    → rosbag records it if a recording is running
```

**Live tuning:**
```
Foxglove Parameters panel: operator edits depth.kp
    → ROS parameter-change callback fires on the bridge
    → bridge builds a SetParameter frame (id=0x00, value)
    → serial → ESP → RobosubController::setParameter() → live immediately
    → ESP Acks; bridge logs it
```

**Save / Reset:**
```
Foxglove Service Call panel → /tardigrade/save_parameters (Trigger)
    → bridge sends SaveParameters (0x09) → ESP writes NVS → Acks
    → bridge returns Trigger.Response(success=True)
```

**Arm / Disarm (new):**
```
Foxglove Service Call panel → /tardigrade/set_armed (armed=true)
    → bridge sends Arm (0x02) → ESP's Safety::arm() → Acks
    → bridge returns SetArmed.Response(success, message)
    → bridge starts sending Heartbeat every ~100ms to the ESP for as long
      as it reports armed — NOT gated on any Foxglove client staying
      connected. This is what keeps Safety::update()'s 300ms link-timeout
      satisfied now that arming is a one-shot service call rather than a
      continuous webapp heartbeat. See "Safety model" below — without this,
      the vehicle would auto-disarm ~300ms after every Foxglove arm call.
```

**Motor test (new):**
```
Foxglove Publish panel → /tardigrade/thrusters/test_cmd, index 3 set to 0.15
    → bridge builds a SetMotor frame (index=3, value=150) → serial → ESP
    → Safety::commandMotor() clamps to the test authority cap, applies it
```

**A subtlety worth building correctly:** the ESP is the actual source of
truth for gain values, not the bridge's ROS parameter cache. If the webapp
(or a direct `SetParameter`) changes a gain, or `ResetParameters` restores
defaults, the bridge's ROS-side parameter mirror has to be refreshed from
what the ESP reports back — via `Parameter` frames — rather than assuming
its own last-written value is still current. Two paths can write the same
logical value; only the ESP's own state should be trusted as ground truth.

## Safety model: physical kill switch, not a software presence beacon

Earlier drafts of this spec required command authority to stay tied to the
webapp's browser-tab heartbeat, so that an operator disappearing (closed tab,
crashed browser, dead network) would reliably disarm the vehicle within
~300 ms — a software deadman. Building an equivalent inside Foxglove turned
out to be genuinely uncertain: Foxglove ships as both a browser tab (Foxglove
Web, whose tab-lifecycle throttling is the same mechanism the webapp already
relies on) and a standalone Electron app (Foxglove Desktop, whose
window/panel lifecycle when minimized or unfocused is not something we've
verified behaves the same way). Moving command traffic through more hops
(`foxglove_bridge` → ROS graph → this bridge node) also means more places a
"the operator is gone" signal could fail to propagate, independent of whether
the presence mechanism itself works.

**None of that matters given the physical kill switch.** It's a hardware
cutoff, reachable without any software or network layer working correctly —
it is the actual backstop, and the software deadman was only ever a
convenience layered on top of it. With that in place, the added-hops and
unverified-beacon concerns don't block moving control into Foxglove.

**The one rule this implies, not optional:** the kill switch is the backstop
*because a human is positioned to reach it*. **Every live test — bench or
water, webapp or Foxglove — runs with someone explicitly on kill-switch
duty.** This is now a procedural rule, not a software property; it belongs in
[bench_checklist.md](bench_checklist.md) and [pid_tuning.md](pid_tuning.md)
as an explicit pre-test check, not just this doc.

**What's dropped from scope as a result:** the custom Foxglove
presence-beacon extension panel, and the "does Desktop vs. Web behave
differently" investigation. Neither is being built.

**The deadman itself is not removed — its job changes.**
`Safety::update()`'s 300 ms link-timeout is still fully active in firmware,
unmodified. What changes is who feeds it: instead of a browser tab's
heartbeat tied to one operator's attention, the bridge sends a continuous
Heartbeat to the ESP for as long as it reports armed, regardless of which (if
any) Foxglove client is currently connected — see the Arm/Disarm data flow
above. The mechanism no longer protects against "the operator looked away" —
the kill switch does that now — but it still protects against a *different*
failure: if the bridge process or the whole Jetson dies or hangs, that
heartbeat stops, and the ESP still auto-disarms within 300 ms. That's a real,
useful property worth keeping — it's just no longer the primary safety
mechanism.

**Also unaffected:** the hardware watchdog and the sensor-timeout failsafe
stay exactly as built — independent of this decision and still fire
regardless of what's on the operator's screen.

## Example Foxglove layouts

Each teammate opens whichever layout matches their role; all connect to the
same live bridge (or the same `.mcap` recording for review).

**Pilot/tuning layout:** Parameters panel (gains + setpoints) · Service Call
buttons for Arm/Disarm/Save/Reset · Publish panel or slider widget for motor
test · Plot (depth setpoint vs. measured) · Plot (heading setpoint vs.
measured) · Diagnostics panel (link health).

**Observer/telemetry layout:** 3D panel (orientation) · Plot (roll/pitch/yaw)
· Plot (depth/vertical velocity) · Diagnostics panel · Raw Messages panel
(`EspState`) for full visibility. Read-only — no service/publish panels.

**Playback/review layout:** identical panels to Observer, data source swapped
for a recorded `.mcap` — no live connection, no Jetson required.

## What's new to build vs. already exists

| Piece | Status |
|---|---|
| ESP firmware / protocol | unchanged |
| Webapp | retained as bench fallback during the transition; retired once this spec is proven |
| Pose delivery to ESP | already built (`JetsonLink`, `ExternalEstimator`, `gcs_server.py --ros`) |
| `EspState.msg` | new, small |
| Bridge: decode `State` → publish `EspState` | new, small — reuses `tp.decode_state` |
| Bridge: gains as ROS parameters + change callback | new, moderate |
| Bridge: sync ROS parameters from the ESP (not just to it) | new, moderate — the subtlety above |
| Bridge: save/reset services | new, small |
| Bridge: `/tardigrade/set_armed` service | new, small — reuses existing `SetArmed.srv` |
| Bridge: continuous Heartbeat to ESP while armed | new, small — replaces the webapp's role in feeding `Safety::update()` |
| Bridge: motor-test topic | new, small |
| Bridge: diagnostics publishing | new, small |
| Foxglove layouts (pilot/observer/playback) | new, no code — saved layout configs only |
| Software presence-beacon panel | **dropped** — physical kill switch supersedes it |

## Open decisions before building

- `std_msgs/Float32MultiArray` for motor test vs. a custom typed message —
  leaning standard type for less boilerplate
- Final `EspState` field set — worth adding the PID P/I/D breakdown once
  that firmware/telemetry addition exists (see the tuning-diagnostics
  discussion — not yet built)
- `DiagnosticArray` (standard, more tooling) vs. a custom diagnostics message
  (more explicit typing)
- Telemetry publish rate — match the existing 20 Hz `GetState` poll, or
  slow it for smaller bag files
- Confirm kill-switch-duty is written into the bench checklist and tuning
  guide as an explicit pre-test step, not just implied by this doc
